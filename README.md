This program does insertion Sort.....

Iterate over the input elements by growing the sorted array at each iteration.

Compare the current element with the largest value available in the sorted array.

If the current element is greater, then it leaves the element in its place and moves on to the next element else it finds its correct position in the sorted array and moves it to that position in the array.

This is achieved by shifting all the elements towards the right, which are larger than the current element, in the sorted array to one position ahead.
